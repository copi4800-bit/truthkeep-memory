# Feature Specification: Consumer Closure Review

**Feature Branch**: `050-consumer-closure-review`  
**Created**: 2026-03-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Perform the Tranche D closure review from `046-consumer-ready-checklist` and decide whether Aegis v4 can now be called consumer-complete.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Evidence-Based Final Judgment (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer, I want one explicit closure review that compares the current repo against the consumer-ready checklist, so the project can make or reject a "consumer-complete" claim on evidence rather than momentum.

**Why this priority**: The repo now has several readiness tranches closed. A final claim still requires a governing review rather than an informal conclusion.

**Independent Test**: Read the closure review and verify that each checklist item has a final judgment, that unresolved partial items are named explicitly, and that the final go/no-go decision follows from that evidence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the current checklist and tranche evidence, **When** the closure review is read, **Then** it states clearly whether Aegis is consumer-complete or not.
2. **Given** unresolved partial items remain, **When** the closure review is issued, **Then** it rejects a completion claim and explains the blockers.

### User Story 2 - Residual Risk Register (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer, I want the remaining consumer-facing risks documented, so future work can target the real blockers instead of re-opening already closed readiness work.

**Why this priority**: The completion claim should fail for a concrete reason, not because of vague discomfort.

**Independent Test**: Confirm that the review lists the remaining risks and maps them to the still-partial checklist items.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the broader host/plugin surface still exposes advanced capabilities, **When** the review is written, **Then** that risk is captured explicitly.
2. **Given** legacy TS-era artifacts still exist in the repo, **When** the review is written, **Then** that residual ambiguity is recorded rather than ignored.

---

### User Story 3 - Next-Step Decision (Priority: P2)

As an implementation maintainer, I want the closure review to say whether another consumer-focused feature is needed or whether the project can stop, so execution can continue without ambiguity.

**Why this priority**: The purpose of closure review is governance, not documentation for its own sake.

**Independent Test**: Verify that the closure review ends with a go/no-go decision and, if no-go, identifies the minimum next feature area.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the review is a no-go, **When** it closes, **Then** it points to the minimum unresolved scope that blocks the consumer-complete label.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if most checklist items are met but one or two remain partial? The review must still reject the final completion claim.
- What happens if some remaining risks are legacy or packaging ambiguities rather than runtime defects? The review must still treat them as blockers if they affect the consumer-complete label.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The closure review MUST compare the current repo against the active checklist in `046-consumer-ready-checklist`.
- **FR-002**: The closure review MUST state a final `GO` or `NO-GO` decision for the claim that Aegis v4 is consumer-complete.
- **FR-003**: The review MUST list unresolved checklist items and residual risks explicitly.
- **FR-004**: The review MUST not approve a completion claim while any required checklist item remains `PARTIAL` or `MISSING`.
- **FR-005**: The review MUST identify the minimum next feature area if the result is `NO-GO`.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **ClosureDecision**: The final `GO` or `NO-GO` judgment for the consumer-complete claim.
- **ResidualRisk**: A remaining issue that blocks or weakens the claim even after prior tranches landed.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A maintainer can read one feature artifact and determine whether Aegis may truthfully be called consumer-complete.
- **SC-002**: Every remaining blocker is named explicitly and tied to active checklist evidence.
- **SC-003**: The review ends with a concrete next-step decision rather than an ambiguous summary.

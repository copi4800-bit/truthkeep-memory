# V10 Spec Mapping

This document maps the formal v8 theory notes to the current runtime implementation.

Reference notes:

- `/home/hali/.openclaw/7.md`
- `/home/hali/.openclaw/11.md`
- `/home/hali/.openclaw/12.md`

Status labels:

- `Exact`: the runtime has a direct, intentional implementation of the spec item.
- `Approx`: the runtime captures the behavior or intent, but not as a literal 1:1 implementation.
- `Missing`: the formal item is not yet represented as a first-class runtime concept.

## Summary

The current runtime is behaviorally aligned with the v8 model:

- evidence-aware memory admission
- state-aware retrieval and ranking
- conflict, trust, belief, decay, readiness, and feedback signals
- transition gates and benchmark-driven validation

The runtime is not yet a literal transcription of the full formal system. In particular, it does not persist the full continuous state vector and it does not maintain a global interacting field object as a first-class runtime structure.

## Key Runtime Anchors

- `aegis_py/app.py`: main orchestration surface
- `aegis_py/memory/ingest.py`: write path and evidence-backed admission
- `aegis_py/retrieval/engine.py`: retrieval score composition and state-aware gating
- `aegis_py/retrieval/v8_dynamics.py`: v8 dynamic signals, transition gate, feedback, energy, reason tags
- `aegis_py/v7/state_machine.py`: discrete state transitions
- `aegis_py/storage/evidence.py`: evidence events and artifacts
- `tests/benchmarks/test_v8_dynamics_sli.py`: benchmark gate for v8 behavior

## Practical Reading

The current codebase should be interpreted as:

- a practical v8 runtime with strong behavioral alignment
- a benchmarkable implementation of the core memory dynamics ideas
- not yet a literal 1:1 execution of the full formal mathematical system

If the project wants stronger formal fidelity later, the next step is not a rewrite. The next step is to define and persist a canonical v8 state contract per memory, then progressively migrate retrieval, hygiene, and governance to consume that contract directly.

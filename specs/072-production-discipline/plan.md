# Implementation Plan: Production Discipline

**Branch**: `072-production-discipline` | **Date**: 2026-03-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](/home/hali/.openclaw/extensions/memory-aegis-v10/specs/072-production-discipline/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/072-production-discipline/spec.md`

## Summary

Finish the production-excellence wave with bounded operational artifacts: one release gate, one soak-test checklist, one rollback checklist, and short runbooks for the most likely operator pain points.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown, shell command references  
**Primary Dependencies**: existing local test commands, systemd user service operations  
**Testing**: manual execution checklists plus referenced pytest commands  
**Target Platform**: Linux local-first deployment with `openclaw-gateway.service`  
**Constraints**: do not expand scope into more runtime features; keep the artifacts short, executable, and repo-local  
**Scale/Scope**: operational discipline only

## Constitution Check

- Preserve the Python-owned runtime boundary.
- Prefer executable operational steps over aspirational prose.
- Stop after one bounded discipline tranche instead of opening another planning tree.

## Deliverables

- `docs/RELEASE-GATE.md`
- `docs/SOAK-TEST-CHECKLIST.md`
- `docs/ROLLBACK-CHECKLIST.md`
- `docs/runbooks/*.md`

## Validation Commands

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/acceptance tests/regression tests/test_observability_runtime.py tests/replication/test_sync.py
```

## Remaining Gap After This Tranche

- Real confidence after this point comes from actually running the soak and rollback drills on staging or production-shaped environments, not from opening more spec slices.

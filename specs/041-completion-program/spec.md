# Feature Specification: Completion Program

**Feature Branch**: `041-completion-program`  
**Created**: 2026-03-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Use GSD + Spec Kit to define what it takes to make Aegis complete: managed distributed memory platform, autonomous self-governing memory, and production hardening"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Define The Managed Platform Target (Priority: P1)

As an Aegis maintainer, I want one canonical specification for how Aegis evolves from a strong local-first engine into a managed distributed memory platform so future work does not drift into vague infrastructure ambition.

**Why this priority**: Without this slice, "100% complete" means different things to different contributors and quickly becomes unreviewable.

**Independent Test**: Read the feature and verify it defines a bounded target for distributed sync, operations, auditability, and production guarantees without pretending they are already implemented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a contributor asks what "managed distributed memory platform" means for Aegis, **When** they inspect this feature, **Then** they find explicit capabilities, guardrails, and non-goals.
2. **Given** a maintainer wants to avoid speculative platform sprawl, **When** they inspect this feature, **Then** they see a bounded program rather than an unstructured wishlist.

---

### User Story 2 - Define The Autonomous Governance Target (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer, I want an explicit specification for "fully autonomous self-governing memory" so autonomy is treated as a governance problem with safety rules, not just more background automation.

**Why this priority**: Autonomy is where Aegis can most easily destroy trust if the target is underspecified.

**Independent Test**: Review the feature and confirm it defines bounded autonomy responsibilities, human override rules, and audit requirements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a contributor wants to add more automatic conflict, decay, or consolidation behavior, **When** they inspect this feature, **Then** they can see which decisions may become autonomous and which must remain user-controlled.
2. **Given** a reviewer asks how autonomous memory stays safe, **When** they inspect this feature, **Then** they find explicit override, rollback, and traceability requirements.

---

### User Story 3 - Define The Final Hardening Program (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer, I want one roadmap that ties managed platform work and autonomous governance back to production hardening so "complete" means operationally trustworthy, not only feature-rich.

**Why this priority**: Product completeness requires operations, migration, observability, and failure handling, not just memory semantics.

**Independent Test**: Inspect the roadmap and confirm it defines ordered tranches that move from current engine maturity toward production-grade infrastructure with measurable gates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the current engine has already completed feature `040`, **When** I inspect this feature, **Then** I can identify the next tranche to implement instead of a vague "finish everything" command.
2. **Given** a maintainer wants to stop at a safe checkpoint, **When** they inspect this feature, **Then** each tranche is independently reviewable and does not require full-program completion to be useful.

---

### User Story 4 - Reconcile Workflow State (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer, I want GSD and Spec Kit aligned to this completion program so the repo has a clear current source of truth for post-`040` work.

**Why this priority**: The repo now needs a new active planning source, not just closed feature artifacts.

**Independent Test**: Run the prerequisite check and confirm it resolves to `041-completion-program` with task artifacts present.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the completion program is active, **When** I run the prerequisite check, **Then** it resolves to `041-completion-program`.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if distributed sync and autonomous governance requirements conflict with local-first operation?
- What happens if autonomy requires more metadata or audit storage than the current schema can safely support?
- How should Aegis behave when distributed nodes disagree but no deterministic merge is safe?
- What must remain user-controlled even after autonomous governance is expanded?
- What production guarantees are mandatory before any hosted or distributed deployment can be called complete?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The repo MUST define a canonical meaning of "Aegis complete" that goes beyond the current local engine and includes managed platform, autonomous governance, and production hardening.
- **FR-002**: The completion program MUST preserve the constitution: local-first must remain the baseline, ambiguous destructive mutation must remain forbidden by default, and explainability must remain non-negotiable.
- **FR-003**: The managed platform target MUST define the minimum capabilities for distributed memory operation, including scope-aware replication or sync governance, auditability, recovery behavior, and operational observability.
- **FR-004**: The autonomous governance target MUST define which memory decisions may become automatic, which remain human-gated, and which require explicit rollback or override paths.
- **FR-005**: The production hardening target MUST define the minimum guarantees for migrations, backup safety, failure recovery, validation, and operational visibility.
- **FR-006**: The completion program MUST decompose the work into ordered tranches, where each tranche is independently reviewable and does not require all future tranches to land before it provides value.
- **FR-007**: The completion program MUST identify the next immediately actionable tranche after `040-resolution-decay-pragmatism`.
- **FR-008**: The completion program MUST state explicit non-goals for the current wave so contributors do not mistake roadmap definition for immediate implementation of hosted distributed services.
- **FR-009**: `.planning/STATE.md` MUST be reconciled to the active `041-completion-program` feature.
- **FR-010**: Validation evidence MUST show the canonical prerequisite workflow resolving to this feature with tasks present.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Managed Distributed Memory Platform**: The future Aegis operating mode where multiple local scopes or nodes can coordinate memory safely with explicit policy, auditability, and recovery.
- **Autonomous Governance Contract**: The rule set defining what Aegis may decide automatically, when it must stop for user input, and how decisions remain reversible and traceable.
- **Production Hardening Gate**: The minimum operational guarantees required before calling Aegis complete for real deployment rather than feature experimentation.
- **Completion Tranche**: A bounded program slice that advances Aegis toward platform maturity without breaking reviewability.

## Tranche Order And Non-Goals

### Ordered Tranches

1. Managed scope replication and operational audit
2. Governance automation with human override
3. Production hardening and SRE-grade guarantees
4. Product closure review

This order is mandatory for the completion program because distributed correctness and auditability are prerequisites for broader autonomous mutation, and both are prerequisites for any credible production-complete claim.

### Explicit Non-Goals For This Wave

- This feature does not implement hosted infrastructure, managed control planes, or cloud-only deployment requirements.
- This feature does not authorize graph-native storage rewrites or replacement of SQLite as the local-first baseline.
- This feature does not permit silent destructive autonomy; aggressive mutation remains out of scope unless a later tranche lands explicit governance and rollback controls.
- This feature does not declare Aegis "complete" today; it only defines the bounded contract that future implementation tranches must satisfy.
- This feature does not collapse the remaining work into one umbrella implementation; every tranche must still open as a reviewable bounded feature.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The completion program defines at least three and no more than six ordered tranches after `040`.
- **SC-002**: The program identifies one explicit next implementation tranche that can be opened immediately as a normal feature.
- **SC-003**: The prerequisite check resolves to `041-completion-program` with `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` present.
- **SC-004**: The repo state points GSD at `041-completion-program` as the active post-`040` source of truth.

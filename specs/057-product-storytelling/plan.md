# Implementation Plan: Product Storytelling

**Branch**: `057-product-storytelling` | **Date**: 2026-03-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/057-product-storytelling/spec.md`

## Summary

Execute the first Tranche B slice by making Aegis easier to understand after one read. This slice adds a clearer product overview, a concise “why Aegis” narrative, and explicit non-goals near the top of the README while preserving the existing beginner path.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown and existing README/runtime-contract tests  
**Primary Dependencies**: `.planning/AEGIS-ADOPTION-ROADMAP.md`, `README.md`, `specs/056-time-to-first-value/`, runtime-contract tests  
**Storage**: N/A  
**Testing**: `pytest` for README contract coverage  
**Target Platform**: newcomer-facing product narrative and maintainer storytelling  
**Constraints**: must stay honest about the current product state; must preserve the beginner quickstart; must not reintroduce beast-lore-first framing  
**Scale/Scope**: README storytelling and targeted test coverage

## Constitution Check

- **Local-First Memory Engine**: Pass. The narrative keeps local-first central.
- **Brownfield Refactor Over Rewrite**: Pass. This is documentation and framing work only.
- **Explainable Retrieval Is Non-Negotiable**: Pass. Explainability remains a differentiator in the story.
- **Safe Memory Mutation By Default**: Pass. The story preserves conflict and lifecycle discipline.
- **Measured Simplicity**: Pass. The entire slice is about comprehension without adding complexity.

```

## Validation Plan

- Add a short product overview, “why Aegis”, and non-goals section near the top of `README.md`.
- Preserve the current quickstart and first-value sections below the product story.
- Add or update README contract tests for the new storytelling sections.
- Re-run:
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_python_only_runtime_contract.py -k "quickstart or first_memory or storytelling"`
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests`

## Expected Evidence

- README opens with a clearer product story
- README includes explicit non-goals aligned with current product truth
- runtime-contract tests lock the new storytelling language
- planning artifacts show `057-product-storytelling` as the next Tranche B slice

## Validation Closeout

Validation run completed on 2026-03-28 for feature `057-product-storytelling`.

Executed commands:

```bash
cd /home/hali/.openclaw/extensions/memory-aegis-v7
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_python_only_runtime_contract.py -k "quickstart or first_memory or storytelling"
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests
```

Observed results:

- `3 passed, 7 deselected` for README storytelling/quickstart contract coverage
- `181 passed in 4.78s` for the full Python suite

Validated additions in this feature:

- `README.md` now opens with a clearer product overview, “why Aegis” narrative, and bounded non-goals
- the beginner quickstart remains intact directly below the product story
- runtime-contract tests now lock the new storytelling language

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations currently require exception handling.

# Feature Specification: Aegis Python CI And Release Packaging Hardening

**Feature Branch**: `003-ci-release-hardening`  
**Created**: 2026-03-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add CI-oriented validation and release packaging workflow for Aegis Python vNext"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - CI Validation Gate (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer, I want the canonical Python validation workflow to run in CI so that regressions are blocked before merge instead of depending on manual local execution.

**Why this priority**: Once local validation exists, the next highest-value gap is making that validation automatic and consistent on every change.

**Independent Test**: This can be fully tested by defining a CI workflow that runs the canonical Python regression command and fails when the suite fails.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a change to retrieval, lifecycle, storage, or integration code, **When** the CI workflow runs, **Then** it executes the canonical Python validation command and reports pass or fail.
2. **Given** a test failure in the Python suite, **When** CI executes the validation workflow, **Then** the workflow fails and makes the regression visible without manual interpretation.

### User Story 2 - Release Packaging Workflow (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer preparing a release, I want a documented and scriptable release packaging workflow so that the Python engine can be versioned, validated, and packaged consistently.

**Why this priority**: CI protects merge quality, but release packaging still remains manual and implicit. That creates release risk even if the codebase is green.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested by following the release packaging workflow in a clean local environment and confirming that the expected release artifacts or packaging steps complete in the documented order.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a clean validated branch, **When** a maintainer follows the release workflow, **Then** they can identify the required validation, packaging, and documentation steps without guesswork.
2. **Given** a packaging precondition is missing, **When** the release workflow is reviewed or executed, **Then** the workflow makes that missing precondition explicit instead of failing silently.

### User Story 3 - Release Evidence Record (Priority: P3)

As a future maintainer, I want release-readiness and packaging evidence recorded in active artifacts so that the next release wave starts from observed facts rather than reconstructed history.

**Why this priority**: CI and packaging only help long-term if the release bar and remaining gaps remain visible in the project artifacts.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested by running the defined validation/release workflow and confirming that the active feature plan captures the command set, observed outcome, and deferred gaps.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a completed CI and release-workflow validation pass, **When** the feature artifacts are updated, **Then** they record what ran, what passed, and what still remains outside the current release bar.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when CI uses a slightly different environment from local development and exposes a missing dependency or path assumption?
- How does the release workflow behave when packaging is requested before the Python validation suite has passed?
- What happens when release artifacts are logically defined but not all packaging tooling is yet present in the repository?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The project MUST define a CI workflow that runs the canonical Python validation command for Aegis Python.
- **FR-002**: The CI validation workflow MUST fail clearly when the Python validation suite fails.
- **FR-003**: The project MUST document a release packaging workflow that identifies required validation steps, packaging steps, and release evidence updates.
- **FR-004**: The release workflow MUST remain compatible with the local-first, offline-capable posture of the engine core.
- **FR-005**: The active planning artifacts MUST record the validated CI/release workflow and any remaining packaging gaps after the feature scope completes.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **CI Validation Workflow**: The automated workflow definition that runs the canonical Python validation command on repository changes.
- **Release Packaging Workflow**: The ordered sequence of validation, packaging, and evidence-recording steps needed to prepare a release.
- **Release Evidence Record**: The artifact entry that captures what validation and release steps were completed and what gaps remain.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A repository change can trigger the CI workflow that runs the canonical Python validation command without manual intervention.
- **SC-002**: The release workflow documentation is specific enough that a maintainer can identify the required validation and packaging steps from the repo alone.
- **SC-003**: The active feature artifacts record the executed CI/release validation steps and explicit deferred gaps for follow-up work.

# Implementation Plan: Production Hardening And SRE-Grade Guarantees

**Branch**: `044-production-hardening` | **Date**: 2026-03-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/044-production-hardening/spec.md`

## Summary

Implement Tranche C of the Aegis Completion Program. This phase now starts by restoring a fully green Python-owned runtime baseline, then hardens the engine through rigorous schema migration management, safe backup/restore drills utilizing SQLite's native backup API, formalized health states, and benchmark/regression gates.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13.x
**Primary Dependencies**: `sqlite3`, `pytest`
**Storage**: SQLite (leveraging `user_version` PRAGMA and native backup API)
**Testing**: `pytest` with a dedicated benchmark and stress-testing directory.
**Target Platform**: Current OpenClaw/MCP runtime
**Project Type**: Memory engine (Operational tooling)
**Constraints**: Backup processes must not lock the database, blocking concurrent reads/writes. Migrations must be declarative and incremental. TypeScript must remain an adapter and must not reclaim memory-domain ownership.
**Scale/Scope**: Impacts Python runtime semantics, DB initialization, backup scripts, test pipelines, and public surface alignment.

## Constitution Check

- **Local-First Memory Engine**: Pass. Formalizes offline "degraded" states as first-class operations rather than errors.
- **Brownfield Refactor Over Rewrite**: Pass. Expanding SQLite utilities rather than switching DBs.
- **Explainable Retrieval Is Non-Negotiable**: Pass. This tranche explicitly includes trust/conflict visibility and retrieval regression recovery because current failures show operations-only hardening is insufficient.
- **Safe Memory Mutation By Default**: Pass. Safe backups guarantee mutation recovery.
- **Measured Simplicity**: Pass. Using built-in SQLite backup APIs rather than complex third-party tools.

## Validation Plan

- Reproduce the current baseline with:
  - `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests`
  - `node_modules/.bin/vitest run test/integration/python-adapter-plugin.test.ts`
- Recover the red Python cases before adding new surface area.
- Verify `backup.py` can clone a database successfully even while an active transaction is writing to it.
- Test the migration manager by bootstrapping an empty DB and a supported legacy DB, ensuring all scripts run in order and update `PRAGMA user_version`.
- Write tests that force the health state to `DEGRADED_SYNC` and assert that local SQLite writes still succeed instantly.
- Establish a benchmark and retrieval regression gate that fails on semantic/trust regressions as well as latency regressions.

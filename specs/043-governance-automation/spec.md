# Feature Specification: Governance Automation With Human Override

**Feature Branch**: `043-governance-automation`
**Created**: 2026-03-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Tranche B of 041-completion-program

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Policy-Bounded Automation (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer, I want a strict policy matrix that dictates which operations (e.g., auto-archive, auto-resolve) are allowed to run automatically, so that the engine does not perform destructive actions without explicit permission.

**Why this priority**: Bounded automation is a core constitutional requirement. Silent, uncontrolled mutation destroys user trust.

**Independent Test**: Configure a test policy that denies "auto-archive" but allows "auto-consolidate". Submit mutations and verify that only consolidation happens automatically while archiving requires manual intervention.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a policy where auto-archive is disabled, **When** a memory reaches its expiration date, **Then** it is flagged for review rather than automatically archived.
2. **Given** a policy where auto-consolidate is enabled, **When** two highly similar memories are detected, **Then** the system automatically consolidates them and logs the action.

### User Story 2 - Audit-First Explanations (Priority: P1)

As an operator, I want every autonomous decision made by the system to include an explicit explanation payload, so I can understand why the system altered my memory.

**Why this priority**: "Explainable retrieval is non-negotiable." This extends to explainable mutations.

**Independent Test**: Trigger an automatic consolidation of two memories. Retrieve the audit log and verify that an explanation (e.g., "Similarity score > 0.95 and temporal overlap") is attached.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an automatic action (e.g., consolidation), **When** the action completes, **Then** an `autonomous_audit_log` entry is created containing the specific reasoning payload.

---

### User Story 3 - Human Override and Rollback (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want the ability to reverse any autonomous mutation and explicitly override the system's decision.

**Why this priority**: Autonomous governance must allow human intervention. Without a rollback path, autonomy is too dangerous for a local-first memory engine.

**Independent Test**: Allow the system to auto-consolidate two memories. Execute a rollback command on that specific action ID and verify the database state returns exactly to how it was before the consolidation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an autonomous mutation that has been applied, **When** an operator issues a rollback command with the audit ID, **Then** the mutation is reverted and the original state is restored.

---

### User Story 4 - Quorum and Confidence Gates (Priority: P2)

As a distributed system operator, I want automatic conflict resolution to only happen if a certain confidence threshold or node quorum is met, otherwise it should fall back to a human `reconcile_required` state.

**Why this priority**: In a distributed setup, heuristic resolution is riskier. We need explicit confidence gates to decide when it's safe to merge.

**Independent Test**: Create a conflict between two nodes. Set the confidence gate to 0.9. Attempt to auto-resolve with a calculated confidence of 0.8. Verify it fails and requests human intervention.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a conflict with a confidence score below the threshold, **When** the engine attempts auto-resolution, **Then** the action is aborted and the status remains `reconcile_required`.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a `PolicyMatrix` configuration allowing operators to toggle `auto_resolve`, `auto_archive`, `auto_consolidate`, and `auto_escalate`.
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate an explanation payload (reasoning) for every autonomous mutation.
- **FR-003**: System MUST record all autonomous decisions in a traceable audit log (potentially extending the existing `replication_audit_log` or creating an `autonomous_audit_log`).
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement a rollback mechanism capable of reverting specific autonomous actions based on their audit ID.
- **FR-005**: System MUST enforce confidence gates for conflict resolution, blocking automatic merges if the confidence is too low.
- **FR-006**: System MUST explicitly define which actions cannot ever be automated (e.g., physical database deletion).

### Key Entities

- **PolicyMatrix**: A configuration object defining the rules for autonomy.
- **AutonomousAction**: A record of a decision made by the system, including its explanation and rollback instructions.
- **ConfidenceGate**: A threshold value required to bypass human intervention.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of autonomous mutations are accompanied by an explanation payload in the audit log.
- **SC-002**: A rollback of an autonomous action restores the specific memory entities to a byte-for-byte identical state prior to the action.
- **SC-003**: Actions explicitly disabled in the PolicyMatrix are never executed without human API calls.

# Implementation Plan: Semantic Memory Product Roadmap

**Branch**: `035-semantic-memory-product-roadmap` | **Date**: 2026-03-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](/home/hali/.openclaw/extensions/memory-aegis-v7/specs/035-semantic-memory-product-roadmap/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/035-semantic-memory-product-roadmap/spec.md`

## Summary

Define the post-`034` execution roadmap as a bounded product sequence that improves semantic recall, correction-first memory quality, long-term trust, and simplicity for non-technical users without bloating the runtime.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: `aegis_py/ARCHITECTURE_BEAST_MAP.md`, existing `memory`, `retrieval`, `hygiene`, `profiles`, `storage`, and `integration` module boundaries  
**Storage**: repo-tracked markdown only  
**Testing**: prerequisite check plus documentation review  
**Constraints**: planning-only scope, preserve the six-module model, avoid introducing more than one new broad front at a time, and translate internal beast language into product-facing outcomes  

## Constitution Check

- `Local-First Memory Engine`: Pass.
- `Brownfield Refactor Over Rewrite`: Pass.
- `Explainable Retrieval Is Non-Negotiable`: Pass.
- `Safe Memory Mutation By Default`: Pass.
- `Measured Simplicity`: Pass.

## Design Direction

- prioritize memory quality by meaning and correction before adding more operational depth
- keep future work bounded to 5-7 slices instead of an open-ended semantic rewrite
- translate beast work into product outcomes such as “remember similar meaning”, “correct bad memory”, and “stay simple for non-technical users”
- keep complexity inside the engine and keep future user surfaces narrow

## Work Plan

1. reconcile `.planning/STATE.md` to feature `035-semantic-memory-product-roadmap`
2. extend the canonical beast map with a post-`034` product roadmap and ordered slice list
3. record the roadmap in `tasks.md` for later execution features
4. validate feature resolution through the canonical prerequisite workflow

## Validation Plan

- run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks`

## Validation Evidence

Observed on 2026-03-24 after creating `035-semantic-memory-product-roadmap`:

- `.planning/STATE.md` now anchors the coordination layer to `035-semantic-memory-product-roadmap`
- the canonical beast architecture document now records a bounded post-`034` roadmap focused on semantic recall, correction-first memory, trust shaping, simple user surfaces, consolidation, and evaluation
- the roadmap keeps future work inside the six-module runtime and limits the next phase to seven ordered slices

Validation results:

- `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks`
  - passed
  - `FEATURE_DIR=/home/hali/.openclaw/extensions/memory-aegis-v7/specs/035-semantic-memory-product-roadmap`
  - `AVAILABLE_DOCS=["tasks.md"]`

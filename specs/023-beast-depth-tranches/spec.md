# Feature Specification: Beast Depth Tranches

**Feature Branch**: `023-beast-depth-tranches`  
**Created**: 2026-03-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Turn the beast roadmap into concrete execution tranches for the remaining partial beasts using GSD + Spec Kit"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Prioritize Partial Beasts Into Executable Tranches (Priority: P1)

As an Aegis maintainer, I want the remaining `partial` beasts grouped into concrete implementation tranches so feature planning can move from philosophy to execution.

**Why this priority**: The roadmap now says what matters most, but the partial beasts still need a stable order that avoids widening the engine too early.

**Independent Test**: Review the tranche plan and verify that the remaining partial beasts are grouped into a small number of execution slices with clear rationale.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a maintainer is choosing the next implementation feature, **When** they inspect the tranche plan, **Then** they can pick the highest-value partial beast slice without guessing.
2. **Given** a contributor wants to avoid architecture sprawl, **When** they follow the tranche plan, **Then** they can deepen the engine in bounded increments rather than opening all partial beasts at once.

### User Story 2 - Define Entry Gates For Deeper Beast Work (Priority: P1)

As an Aegis architect, I want explicit entry gates for each tranche so deeper beast work starts only when benchmark movement, safety pressure, or operator pain justify it.

**Why this priority**: Partial beasts can become expensive quickly, so they need measurable triggers instead of lore-driven expansion.

**Independent Test**: Review the tranche plan and confirm every tranche has at least one clear entry gate.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a contributor wants to deepen retrieval or hygiene, **When** they inspect the tranche plan, **Then** they find concrete triggers such as recall misses, maintenance pain, or retrieval ambiguity.
2. **Given** a maintainer wants to defer complexity, **When** they inspect the tranche plan, **Then** they can justify why a tranche remains unopened.

### User Story 3 - Reconcile Workflow State (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer, I want the repo state and Spec Kit artifacts aligned to this new tranche feature so planning remains reviewable and reproducible.

**Why this priority**: The user asked to keep working through SPD/GSD plus Spec Kit, so the next execution slice must be tracked as a real feature.

**Independent Test**: Run the prerequisite check and confirm it resolves to `023-beast-depth-tranches` with task artifacts present.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the tranche feature is active, **When** I run the prerequisite check, **Then** the repo resolves to `023-beast-depth-tranches`.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The repo MUST define concrete execution tranches for the beasts that remain in `partial` status.
- **FR-002**: Each tranche MUST identify the beasts it deepens, the module area it touches, and why that slice is grouped together.
- **FR-003**: Each tranche MUST define at least one entry gate grounded in benchmark movement, safety need, or operator pain.
- **FR-004**: The tranche plan MUST preserve the six-module runtime model and MUST NOT imply broad subsystem proliferation.
- **FR-005**: The canonical beast architecture document MUST record the tranche sequence in repo-tracked form.
- **FR-006**: `.planning/STATE.md` MUST be reconciled to the active `023-beast-depth-tranches` feature.
- **FR-007**: Validation evidence MUST show that the canonical prerequisite workflow resolves to the `023` feature.

### Key Entities

- **Execution Tranche**: A bounded implementation slice that deepens a small set of related partial beasts together.
- **Entry Gate**: A measurable trigger that justifies opening a tranche.
- **Deferred Slice**: A tranche that remains intentionally unopened until its entry gate is met.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All remaining partial beasts are assigned to concrete execution tranches.
- **SC-002**: Each tranche lists explicit gates for when it should begin.
- **SC-003**: The prerequisite check resolves to `023-beast-depth-tranches` with its `tasks.md` artifact present.

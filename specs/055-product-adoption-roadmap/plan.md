# Implementation Plan: Product Adoption Roadmap

**Branch**: `055-product-adoption-roadmap` | **Date**: 2026-03-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/055-product-adoption-roadmap/spec.md`

## Summary

Create one governing roadmap that turns the “steal the good parts” product strategy into an explicit execution plan. The roadmap will identify the twelve high-value traits Aegis should borrow from Mem0, NeuralMemory, and strong RAG systems, define the Aegis core that must not be diluted, and order the work into practical tranches.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown only  
**Primary Dependencies**: `specs/053-aegis-competitive-scorecard/`, `specs/054-default-surface-consistency/`, current README/runtime evidence, `.planning/ROADMAP.md`, `.planning/STATE.md`  
**Storage**: N/A  
**Testing**: manual artifact review  
**Target Platform**: maintainer roadmap and future feature-scoping workflow  
**Constraints**: must not overpromise features that do not exist yet; must preserve Aegis core invariants; should produce a roadmap that can directly steer future Spec Kit features  
**Scale/Scope**: one roadmap artifact plus planning references

## Constitution Check

- **Local-First Memory Engine**: Pass. The roadmap explicitly preserves local-first control.
- **Brownfield Refactor Over Rewrite**: Pass. The roadmap is about selective product adoption, not replacement.
- **Explainable Retrieval Is Non-Negotiable**: Pass. Retrieval clarity and citations remain in scope as strengths to sharpen.
- **Safe Memory Mutation By Default**: Pass. Conflict awareness and lifecycle hygiene remain protected invariants.
- **Measured Simplicity**: Pass. The roadmap exists to make Aegis easier to use without turning it into feature soup.

## Validation Plan

- Create `.planning/AEGIS-ADOPTION-ROADMAP.md` with the twelve adoption items, protected Aegis invariants, and tranche structure.
- Record the roadmap under `specs/055-product-adoption-roadmap/`.
- Update GSD planning artifacts so future work can cite the roadmap.

## Expected Evidence

- one roadmap document with twelve adoption items and preserved core invariants
- one spec/plan/tasks triplet under `specs/055-product-adoption-roadmap/`
- roadmap/state references showing this strategy is now part of repo planning

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations currently require exception handling.

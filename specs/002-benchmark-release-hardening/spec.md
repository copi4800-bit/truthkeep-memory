# Feature Specification: Aegis Python Benchmark And Release Hardening

**Feature Branch**: `002-benchmark-release-hardening`  
**Created**: 2026-03-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Expand benchmark fixtures and contributor release validation workflow for Aegis Python vNext"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Broader Retrieval Regression Corpus (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer changing retrieval logic, I want a broader seeded benchmark corpus and gate so that relevance, scope leakage, conflict visibility, and explainability regressions are caught before code lands.

**Why this priority**: Retrieval quality is the product core. If the benchmark corpus is too small, benchmark gating becomes symbolic instead of protective.

**Independent Test**: This can be fully tested by running the local benchmark-oriented Python suite against a seeded corpus with multiple scopes, conflict cases, and empty-result cases, then verifying that threshold evaluation passes only when the canonical retrieval contract still holds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** benchmark fixtures covering project, session, and global scopes, **When** the benchmark gate runs, **Then** it reports threshold results for relevance, leakage, explainability, and latency using more than one retrieval shape.
2. **Given** a retrieval change that causes cross-scope leakage or missing explanation fields, **When** the benchmark gate is evaluated, **Then** the gate fails with explicit reasons identifying the violated metric.
3. **Given** a query containing punctuation-heavy tokens or no lexical matches, **When** the benchmark corpus includes those cases, **Then** the benchmark run completes without query parser failure and records the expected result shape.

### User Story 2 - Contributor Validation Workflow (Priority: P2)

As a contributor to Aegis Python, I want a documented and repeatable local validation workflow so that I can verify storage, retrieval, lifecycle, and integration behavior before proposing changes.

**Why this priority**: The engine is now test-covered, but contributors still need one obvious path for running the right validation set. Without that, quality depends on tribal knowledge.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested by following the documented validation workflow from a clean local environment and confirming that the listed commands exercise the intended benchmark and regression suites.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a contributor with the repo checked out locally, **When** they follow the validation instructions, **Then** they can run the Python regression suite and benchmark gate without needing hidden environment assumptions.
2. **Given** a contributor changing retrieval or MCP behavior, **When** they consult the docs, **Then** they can identify which commands and artifacts serve as the pre-merge validation bar.

### User Story 3 - Release Readiness Summary (Priority: P3)

As a maintainer preparing the next Aegis Python baseline, I want an explicit release-readiness summary and remaining-gap record so that the next work wave is planned from observed evidence instead of memory.

**Why this priority**: Once validation and benchmark gates exist, the team still needs a stable place to record what was validated and what remains outside the current release bar.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested by completing the validation workflow, recording the observed outputs in the active feature artifacts, and checking that remaining gaps are explicit and actionable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a completed local validation run, **When** release-readiness artifacts are updated, **Then** they record the executed validation command, observed result, and remaining risks or deferred work.
2. **Given** a future maintainer starting the next feature wave, **When** they read the active plan and related docs, **Then** they can distinguish completed quality gates from follow-up work that still requires a new spec or implementation phase.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the benchmark corpus expands but some scenarios legitimately return empty results rather than hits?
- How does the gate behave when latency stays acceptable but explanation completeness drops below the required floor?
- What happens when retrieval fixtures depend on local environment state such as an existing database path or stale generated files?
- How does the contributor workflow stay accurate if the active validation command changes between feature waves?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST define a benchmark gate contract that evaluates retrieval relevance, scope leakage, conflict leakage, explanation completeness, and latency against explicit thresholds.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST support a seeded benchmark corpus broad enough to cover scoped retrieval, anti-leak behavior, conflict visibility, punctuation-heavy queries, and empty-result behavior.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST report benchmark gate failures with concrete metric identifiers so that maintainers can see which threshold failed.
- **FR-004**: The project MUST document a repeatable local validation workflow for Python regression tests and benchmark gating.
- **FR-005**: The contributor-facing documentation MUST identify the canonical validation command or commands needed before merging retrieval, lifecycle, storage, or integration changes.
- **FR-006**: The active feature planning artifacts MUST record the observed outcome of the validation workflow and any remaining release gaps after the feature scope is complete.
- **FR-007**: The hardening workflow MUST remain local-first and must not require cloud services or external hosted infrastructure to run the benchmark gate.
- **FR-008**: The release-readiness summary MUST distinguish validated engine behavior from deferred work that should be handled in a future feature wave.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Benchmark Threshold Set**: The authoritative collection of minimum or maximum values used to decide whether retrieval quality is acceptable.
- **Benchmark Query Case**: A seeded retrieval scenario containing query text, expected hits, forbidden hits, scope information, and test intent.
- **Validation Workflow**: The documented sequence of local commands used to verify the current engine baseline before release or merge.
- **Release Readiness Record**: The summary stored in active feature artifacts describing what was validated, what passed, and what remains outside the current baseline.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The benchmark gate can fail with explicit metric names when any seeded retrieval case violates the defined regression thresholds.
- **SC-002**: The benchmark-oriented Python suite covers at least scoped retrieval, anti-leak retrieval, conflict-visible retrieval, punctuation-safe retrieval, and empty-result behavior.
- **SC-003**: A contributor can follow the documented validation workflow and run the intended local regression command set without needing undocumented steps.
- **SC-004**: The active feature artifacts contain a release-readiness summary with the executed validation command, observed result, and explicit remaining gaps for the next feature wave.

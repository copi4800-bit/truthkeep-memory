# Implementation Plan: Completion Program

**Branch**: `041-completion-program` | **Date**: 2026-03-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Summary

Define the post-`040` completion program for Aegis. This feature does not claim that Aegis is already "100% complete". Instead, it makes "complete" concrete and reviewable by decomposing the remaining work into three maturity targets: managed distributed platform capability, autonomous governance capability, and production hardening capability.

The developer-facing execution roadmap for these tranches is documented in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13.x plus the existing TypeScript bootstrap shell  
**Primary Dependencies**: Spec artifacts under `specs/`, repo workflow in `.planning/`, existing Python runtime modules under `aegis_py/`  
**Storage**: SQLite remains the current baseline source of truth; future distributed capabilities must preserve local-first operation  
**Testing**: Spec/workflow validation now; later tranches must continue using `pytest`, integration tests, and benchmark evidence  
**Target Platform**: Current local-first OpenClaw/MCP runtime, with future optional distributed operation defined but not yet implemented  
**Project Type**: Product/program roadmap feature for a local memory engine evolving toward platform maturity  
**Performance Goals**: Keep the program bounded and tranche-oriented; do not destabilize the validated engine by opening a giant umbrella implementation  
**Constraints**: Must not violate constitution, must not imply graph-native or cloud-mandatory rewrites, must stay migration-friendly and audit-friendly  
**Scale/Scope**: One roadmap/program feature covering the remaining maturity ladder beyond `040`

## Constitution Check

- **Local-First Memory Engine**: Pass. The completion program treats local-first as baseline and any distributed mode as additive rather than mandatory.
- **Brownfield Refactor Over Rewrite**: Pass. The program is tranche-based and extends the existing runtime rather than replacing it wholesale.
- **Explainable Retrieval Is Non-Negotiable**: Pass. Distributed and autonomous futures remain subject to explainability and audit requirements.
- **Safe Memory Mutation By Default**: Pass. Autonomy is explicitly framed as a governance and rollback problem, not permission for silent aggressive mutation.
- **Measured Simplicity**: Pass. The program intentionally decomposes the remaining work instead of pretending a single mega-feature can deliver "100% complete" safely.

## Program Tranches

### Tranche A: Managed Scope Replication And Operational Audit

Goal: Move from local-only sync scaffolding to a real managed distributed memory contract while preserving local-first defaults.

Required outcomes:
- explicit node or replica identity
- scope-aware sync policy enforcement
- sync conflict visibility and reconcile workflow
- distributed audit trail and replay-safe imports
- operational observability for sync state and failures

Why first: This tranche turns Aegis into a platform candidate without yet granting broad autonomy.

### Tranche B: Governance Automation With Human Override

Goal: Expand Aegis from bounded suggestion-first automation to a governed autonomous system.

Required outcomes:
- policy matrix for what may auto-resolve, auto-archive, auto-consolidate, and auto-escalate
- rollback and override paths for every automatic mutation class
- explicit quorum or confidence gates for distributed conflict decisions
- audit-first explanation for every autonomous decision

Why second: Autonomy without distributed correctness and auditability would be unsafe.

### Tranche C: Production Hardening And SRE-Grade Guarantees

Goal: Make Aegis operationally complete enough to call production-grade infrastructure.

Required outcomes:
- migration and rollback discipline for long-lived data
- backup integrity verification and restore drills
- observability, alerts, and degradation modes
- durability and recovery playbooks
- benchmark and regression gates for semantic, lifecycle, and distributed behavior

Why third: Hardening is what turns a strong architecture into a reliable product.

### Tranche D: Product Closure Review

Goal: Re-assess whether Aegis now deserves the label "complete" for the chosen deployment class.

Required outcomes:
- explicit comparison of implemented capabilities vs the completion contract
- unresolved gaps list
- revised non-goals and future scope boundaries

Why final: "Complete" is a governance decision, not just a count of landed features.

## Immediate Next Slice

The next actionable implementation slice should be a normal bounded feature under the completion program:

`managed scope replication and operational audit`

That slice should focus on turning the current file-based sync scaffolding into a governed multi-node or multi-replica sync contract with policy, replay safety, and observable failure states.

## Validation Plan

- `SPECIFY_FEATURE=041-completion-program ./.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks`

## Validation Evidence

Planning-only evidence recorded on 2026-03-24:

- feature `041-completion-program` was created to become the post-`040` source of truth for what "complete" means
- the feature now defines ordered completion tranches rather than pretending full completion can be shipped safely as one unbounded task
- `.planning/STATE.md` is reconciled to point GSD at `041-completion-program`
- canonical prerequisite workflow executed on 2026-03-24 and resolved `FEATURE_DIR=/home/hali/.openclaw/extensions/memory-aegis-v10/specs/041-completion-program`
- prerequisite workflow confirmed task artifacts are present via `AVAILABLE_DOCS=["tasks.md"]`; `spec.md` and `plan.md` are the canonical documents for the active feature directory itself

Implementation evidence is intentionally pending because this feature is a program-definition slice, not the managed platform implementation itself.

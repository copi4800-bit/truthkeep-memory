# V10 Gap Roadmap

This roadmap focuses on the smallest set of changes that would move the runtime from strong behavioral alignment toward stronger formal fidelity with the v10 theory notes.

Reference:

- [V8_SPEC_MAPPING.md](/home/hali/.openclaw/extensions/memory-aegis-v10/docs/V8_SPEC_MAPPING.md)

## Priority 1

### 1. Persist a canonical v10 state contract per memory

Goal:

- make the runtime state explicit instead of partly derived and partly implicit

Add a normalized per-memory state contract, for example:

```json
{
  "belief_score": 0.0,
  "usage_signal": 0.0,
  "decay_signal": 0.0,
  "conflict_signal": 0.0,
  "readiness_score": 0.0,
  "trust_score": 0.0,
  "regret_signal": 0.0,
  "stability_signal": 0.0,
  "feedback_count": 0.0,
  "belief_delta": 0.0,
  "last_v8_update_at": "..."
}
```

Why first:

- this is the bridge between the formal model and the runtime
- it reduces hidden coupling between retrieval-time recomputation and stored memory behavior
- it makes debugging and audits much easier

Suggested implementation:

- define one canonical serializer/deserializer
- store under a single metadata key such as `v8_state`
- migrate current `v10_dynamics` metadata into that contract

### 2. Separate derived signals from persisted state

Goal:

- avoid mixing stored state with query-specific or runtime-only calculations

Persist:

- belief
- usage
- decay
- conflict
- readiness
- regret

Derive at retrieval time:

- query-conditioned retrieval score
- dynamic score bonus
- query-specific reason tags
- bundle objective over a selected result set

Why:

- the formal notes separate system state from retrieval-time decision logic
- this reduces ambiguity about what changed after feedback versus what changed only because of a new query

## Priority 2

### 3. Make the transition operator a first-class runtime surface

Goal:

- move from “transition logic exists” to a clear `Tau`-like contract

Add:

- one function or service that accepts current memory state and outputs transition decision
- explicit persistence of transition inputs and outputs
- a stable transition reason schema

Why:

- the notes treat transition as a core operator, not an incidental detail
- this improves explainability for `draft -> validated`, `validated -> hypothesized`, and later `validated -> consolidated`

### 4. Normalize support and conflict into explicit edge/state inputs

Goal:

- reduce the gap between the formal interaction field and the current ad hoc support/conflict weights

Add:

- a stable representation for support and conflict contributors
- explicit provenance for why support/conflict weights were computed
- optional cached aggregate values on each memory

Why:

- the current runtime captures the behavior, but not the structure of the interaction system
- this would make `A(t)` approximations much more inspectable

## Priority 3

### 5. Promote trust and readiness to first-class observable fields

Goal:

- stop treating them as mostly retrieval-side internals

Add:

- storage visibility for current trust/readiness snapshots
- operator surfaces to inspect them directly
- tests that assert trust/readiness stability across key workflows

Why:

- the notes make both quantities central
- product behavior already depends on them, so they should be inspectable without reading internal code

### 6. Add a formal field snapshot surface for `Xi(t)`

Goal:

- expose a coarse-grained whole-system snapshot without building a heavy simulation framework

Example payload:

```json
{
  "counts": {
    "draft": 0,
    "validated": 0,
    "consolidated": 0,
    "hypothesized": 0,
    "invalidated": 0,
    "archived": 0
  },
  "averages": {
    "belief_score": 0.0,
    "trust_score": 0.0,
    "readiness_score": 0.0,
    "conflict_signal": 0.0,
    "decay_signal": 0.0
  },
  "energy": {
    "bundle_energy_proxy": 0.0,
    "objective_proxy": 0.0
  }
}
```

Why:

- the theory is about a memory field, not only isolated memories
- this gives you practical observability without requiring full continuous-time simulation

## Priority 4

### 7. Tighten write-time belief initialization against the formal feature set

Goal:

- align initial confidence more explicitly with the formal write operator

Current runtime already uses write-time scoring. Strengthen it by making the feature mapping explicit:

- directness
- specificity
- source reliability
- evidence completeness
- ambiguity/noise

Why:

- this is one of the cleanest places to improve formal fidelity with low architectural risk

### 8. Expand benchmark gates from behavior to state fidelity

Goal:

- test not only outcomes, but also whether internal state evolves in expected directions

Add benchmark assertions such as:

- evidence gain should increase belief and trust
- repeated successful retrieval should increase usage and readiness
- persistent conflict should increase conflict and demotion pressure
- failure/override should increase regret and reduce effective trust/readiness

Why:

- this is the safest way to drive the runtime closer to the formal model without a rewrite

## Recommended order

1. Persist canonical `v8_state`
2. Separate persisted state from query-derived signals
3. Make transition a first-class operator surface
4. Normalize support/conflict inputs
5. Expose trust/readiness directly
6. Add `Xi(t)` snapshot surface
7. Tighten write-time initialization
8. Expand benchmark gates to internal state fidelity

## Non-goals for now

These would add cost quickly and should wait:

- full continuous-time simulation engine
- literal global interaction matrix materialization for every query
- full Bayesian graph update machinery
- forcing every formal variable into a dedicated SQL column immediately

## Practical target

If the team completes the first four items, the runtime would move from:

- behaviorally strong v10

to:

- behaviorally strong v10 with a credible explicit state model

That is the right threshold before attempting a deeper formalization pass.

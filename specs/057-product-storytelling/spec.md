# Feature Specification: Product Storytelling

**Feature Branch**: `057-product-storytelling`  
**Created**: 2026-03-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Execute the first Tranche B slice from `.planning/AEGIS-ADOPTION-ROADMAP.md` by making Aegis easier to understand and easier to explain after one read.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Newcomer Understands What Aegis Is Quickly (Priority: P1)

As a newcomer, I want a short product explanation near the top of the README, so I can tell what Aegis does, what makes it different, and whether it is for me without reading architecture details first.

**Independent Test**: Open the README and verify that the top section explains what Aegis is, what it is good at, and what it does not try to be.

### User Story 2 - Maintainer Can Reuse One Clear Story (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer, I want one product narrative that I can repeat consistently, so Aegis is described by product value rather than by beast lore or internal module details.

**Independent Test**: Verify that the README includes a concise “why Aegis” story and explicit non-goals that align with the Python-owned product boundary.

### User Story 3 - The README Separates Product Story From Deep Technical Reference (Priority: P2)

As a newcomer or integrator, I want the README to move from product story to beginner path and only then into deeper technical reference, so I do not hit implementation detail before value proposition.

**Independent Test**: Verify that product overview and first-value sections appear before dense technical reference material.

## Requirements

- **FR-001**: The README MUST include a short product overview that explains what Aegis is in plain language.
- **FR-002**: The README MUST explain why Aegis exists and what core traits differentiate it.
- **FR-003**: The README MUST include explicit non-goals so users do not mistake Aegis for a managed-only or complexity-first system.
- **FR-004**: The feature MUST preserve the current beginner quickstart and default user path while improving comprehension.
- **FR-005**: GSD planning artifacts MUST record this slice as the first Tranche B execution feature.

## Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: A newcomer can read the README top section and understand Aegis as a product before reading technical details.
- **SC-002**: A maintainer can point to one concise narrative for what Aegis is and why it matters.
- **SC-003**: The README flows from product story to first value to technical reference in a clearer order.

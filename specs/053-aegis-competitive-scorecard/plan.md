# Implementation Plan: Aegis Competitive Scorecard

**Branch**: `053-aegis-competitive-scorecard` | **Date**: 2026-03-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/053-aegis-competitive-scorecard/spec.md`

## Summary

Create one reusable scorecard that measures whether Aegis is actually becoming superior as a memory product, not just more architecturally elaborate. The scorecard will score seven dimensions, explain each score with evidence, and define a threshold-based decision rule for future milestone reviews.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown only  
**Primary Dependencies**: `.planning/`, current runtime docs, recent planning/verification artifacts  
**Storage**: N/A  
**Testing**: Manual artifact review  
**Target Platform**: Maintainer planning and review workflow  
**Project Type**: Product-governance and evaluation artifact  
**Performance Goals**: N/A  
**Constraints**: Must reflect the current runtime, not a historical Aegis branch; must be specific enough to steer roadmap decisions  
**Scale/Scope**: One reusable scorecard document plus planning references

## Constitution Check

- **Local-First Memory Engine**: Pass. The scorecard evaluates present local-first product quality.
- **Brownfield Refactor Over Rewrite**: Pass. This is governance/documentation work only.
- **Explainable Retrieval Is Non-Negotiable**: Pass. Explainability is one of the scored dimensions.
- **Safe Memory Mutation By Default**: Pass. Scope integrity, conflict usefulness, and hygiene payoff are explicit score dimensions.
- **Measured Simplicity**: Pass. Product simplicity and packaging friction are explicit score dimensions.

## Validation Plan

- Create the reusable scorecard in `.planning/AEGIS-SCORECARD.md`
- Record the scorecard feature in `specs/053-aegis-competitive-scorecard/`
- Update GSD planning artifacts to point future work at the scorecard

## Expected Evidence

- one scorecard document with all seven dimensions scored
- one spec/plan/tasks triplet under `specs/053-aegis-competitive-scorecard/`
- roadmap/state references showing that the scorecard now exists as a governance artifact

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations currently require exception handling.

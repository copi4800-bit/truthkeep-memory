# Feature Specification: Demo And Benchmark Presentation

**Feature Branch**: `058-demo-and-benchmark-presentation`  
**Created**: 2026-03-28  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Input**: Execute the next Tranche B slice by giving Aegis one easy-to-run demo path and one benchmark summary that non-specialists can understand.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Newcomer Can Run One Demo And Feel The Product (Priority: P1)

As a newcomer, I want one runnable demo script that shows setup, remember, and recall in a short narrative flow, so I can see Aegis working without assembling commands manually.

**Independent Test**: Run the demo script from the repo and verify that it prints a short, understandable first-value walkthrough.

### User Story 2 - Maintainer Can Point To A Readable Benchmark Story (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer, I want the README to summarize what the benchmark scripts are trying to prove in plain language, so benchmark value is understandable without reading raw benchmark code.

**Independent Test**: Open the README and verify that it includes a demo section and a benchmark summary section that describe the current evidence in product terms.

### User Story 3 - Product Story Stays Grounded In Existing Evidence (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer, I want the demo and benchmark presentation to stay tied to real scripts and current gates, so Aegis sounds credible instead of pitch-heavy.

**Independent Test**: Verify that the README references actual demo and benchmark files that exist in the repo.

## Requirements

- **FR-001**: The repo MUST include one runnable demo script for newcomer first value.
- **FR-002**: The README MUST explain what the demo proves and how to run it.
- **FR-003**: The README MUST include a benchmark summary section that explains the current benchmark gates in product-facing language.
- **FR-004**: The presentation MUST reference real repo scripts and current benchmark evidence only.
- **FR-005**: GSD planning artifacts MUST record this slice as the next Tranche B execution feature.

## Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: A newcomer can run one script and see a short Aegis success story.
- **SC-002**: A maintainer can point to one benchmark summary that explains what current retrieval gates mean in practice.
- **SC-003**: The repo feels more demoable without exaggerating current capabilities.

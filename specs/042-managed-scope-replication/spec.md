# Feature Specification: Managed Scope Replication And Operational Audit

**Feature Branch**: `042-managed-scope-replication`
**Created**: 2026-03-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Tranche A of 041-completion-program

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Replica Identity and Provenance (Priority: P1)

As an Aegis operator, I want each node or replica to have an explicit identity so that memory changes can be traced back to their origin when syncing across multiple devices.

**Why this priority**: Without node identity, safe distributed replication is impossible because we cannot determine provenance or prevent infinite sync loops.

**Independent Test**: Create two Aegis instances, configure explicit identities, and verify that changes originating in Instance A carry Instance A's signature when imported into Instance B.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** two Aegis instances A and B, **When** they generate node identities, **Then** they must be distinct.
2. **Given** a new memory mutation on node A, **When** synced to B, **Then** B's audit log shows the mutation originated from A.

### User Story 2 - Replay-Safe Scope Sync (Priority: P1)

As an Aegis system, I want replication to be replay-safe so that if a sync operation is interrupted or duplicated, memory is not corrupted.

**Why this priority**: Partial failures in distributed systems are guaranteed. Sync must be idempotent to prevent duplicate data or corrupted state.

**Independent Test**: Force-interrupt a sync batch halfway through and re-run it, verifying that the final state matches a single successful run.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a batch of incoming mutations, **When** the batch is applied twice, **Then** the database state remains identical after the first and second applications.

---

### User Story 3 - Conflict Visibility and Reconciliation (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer, I want distributed sync conflicts (e.g., concurrent edits to the same entity on different nodes) to be explicitly visible and reviewable rather than silently overwritten or merged destructively.

**Why this priority**: Safe mutation by default is a constitutional rule. Silent destructive merges violate this.

**Independent Test**: Create a conflicting edit on node A and node B while disconnected, then sync. Verify that the conflict is flagged for review rather than silently resolved.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** concurrent mutations to the same entity, **When** they sync, **Then** the system surfaces a "reconcile-required" state.
2. **Given** a "reconcile-required" state, **When** an operator resolves the conflict, **Then** the resolution is recorded with an audit trail.

---

### User Story 4 - Operational Observability (Priority: P2)

As an operator, I want to see sync health, lag, and failure reporting so I can monitor the reliability of my distributed Aegis deployment.

**Why this priority**: Production hardening requires visibility. Operators need to know if sync is failing silently.

**Independent Test**: Disconnect node A and node B, wait for local mutations, and check observability outputs for reported sync lag and failure states.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a failing network connection between nodes, **When** sync is attempted, **Then** a failure state is logged and visible to operators.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if a node receives a replication payload for an unknown scope?
- How does the system handle an extremely large backlog of sync operations after prolonged offline use?
- What happens if node A and node B both claim the same identity?
- How is the audit log managed so it doesn't grow infinitely?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support generating and persisting explicit node or replica identities.
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce scope-aware sync policies, allowing restriction of what data syncs to which nodes.
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement replay-safe (idempotent) import of replication payloads.
- **FR-004**: System MUST record an audit log for all distributed mutations, preserving provenance (originating node identity).
- **FR-005**: System MUST detect concurrent mutation conflicts and surface them for explicit reconciliation rather than silently overwriting data.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide observability outputs reporting sync lag, recent failures, and outstanding conflicts.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide migration paths for existing local-only databases to adopt node identities without data loss.

### Key Entities

- **Node Identity**: A unique identifier and metadata for an Aegis replica.
- **Replication Payload**: A batch of memory mutations packaged for sync.
- **Audit Record**: A ledger entry detailing a mutation, its provenance, and the time it was applied locally.
- **Conflict State**: A marker indicating that deterministic merge is unsafe and operator intervention is required.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Replaying an identical replication payload results in 0 duplicate records and 0 errors.
- **SC-002**: 100% of concurrent edits to the same entity result in a visible conflict state rather than silent data loss.
- **SC-003**: Sync failure states are logged within 1 second of operation failure.
- **SC-004**: Existing local-only instances can migrate to the multi-node schema with 100% data preservation.

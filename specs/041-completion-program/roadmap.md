# Developer Roadmap: Aegis Completion Program

**Program Feature**: `041-completion-program`  
**Date**: 2026-03-24  
**Governing Artifacts**: [spec.md](spec.md), [plan.md](plan.md), `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

## Purpose

This roadmap tells implementation developers how to finish Aegis from the current post-`040` engine state to a reviewable "complete" product state without skipping Spec Kit discipline, constitutional guardrails, or validation evidence.

This document is execution guidance under the active `041` feature. It does not replace `spec.md`, `plan.md`, or future tranche feature artifacts.

## Program Rule

No developer may claim Aegis is "100% complete" until all roadmap tranches below are implemented, validated, and closed out with explicit evidence.

Every material tranche must become its own feature under `specs/*` before major code changes begin.

## Completion Standard

Aegis may be called complete only when all of the following are true:

1. Managed distributed platform capabilities exist in reviewed code, with tests and auditability.
2. Autonomous governance exists only within explicit policy and rollback boundaries.
3. Production hardening guarantees are implemented and validated.
4. A final closure review confirms that no completion-contract gaps remain for the chosen deployment class.

## Delivery Sequence

### Stage 0: Program Governance And Repo Hygiene

Goal: Keep the execution path aligned with the completion contract before opening new implementation work.

Required actions:
- keep `041-completion-program` as the active source of truth until the next tranche feature opens
- require every developer to identify the active feature before coding
- require `.planning/*` to remain derivative of `specs/*`
- stage and commit the `041` planning artifacts before or together with the first tranche feature

Exit gate:
- `041` artifacts are present, reviewed, and committed
- maintainers agree the next execution feature is Tranche A

## Tranche A: Managed Scope Replication And Operational Audit

Goal: Evolve the current local-first engine into a governed multi-node or multi-replica memory platform without making hosted infrastructure mandatory.

Open a new feature for this tranche before coding.

Feature charter:
- replica or node identity model
- scope-aware sync policy contract
- import or replication replay safety
- visible conflict states and reconcile workflow
- audit log for distributed mutation and replay
- operator-visible sync health and failure reporting

Mandatory deliverables:
- tranche feature `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`
- schema or metadata updates for node identity, replication provenance, and audit trails
- sync workflow tests covering safe replay, duplicate protection, and partial failure handling
- observability outputs for sync lag, failure state, and reconcile-required state
- migration notes for existing local-only installs

Mandatory tests and evidence:
- integration tests for multi-node or multi-replica sync behavior
- conflict-path tests where deterministic merge is unsafe
- recovery-path tests for interrupted imports or replay attempts
- validation evidence written back to the tranche `plan.md`

Tranche A Definition of Done:
- distributed sync is policy-governed, not implicit
- conflicts are visible and reviewable
- replay safety is implemented and tested
- local-first offline operation still works without hosted dependencies

## Tranche B: Governance Automation With Human Override

Goal: Introduce bounded autonomous memory governance only after distributed correctness and auditability exist.

Open a new feature for this tranche before coding.

Feature charter:
- policy matrix for automatic actions
- confidence or quorum gates for distributed decisions
- user override, rollback, and escalation paths
- full explanation trail for every autonomous mutation
- explicit list of actions that remain human-controlled

Mandatory deliverables:
- tranche feature `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`
- policy engine or equivalent bounded governance surface
- rollback primitives for each automatic mutation class
- explanation payloads that show why an automatic action happened
- operator controls to disable or narrow autonomy safely

Mandatory tests and evidence:
- policy tests for allowed, denied, and escalation-required cases
- rollback tests for each automatic mutation path
- audit-trace tests proving every autonomous decision is explainable
- safety tests proving forbidden silent destructive mutation still cannot happen by default

Tranche B Definition of Done:
- autonomy is bounded by policy, not heuristics alone
- every automatic mutation has a rollback path
- maintainers can explain and override every autonomous decision

## Tranche C: Production Hardening And SRE-Grade Guarantees

Goal: Make the platform operationally trustworthy for long-lived deployment.

Open a new feature for this tranche before coding.

Feature charter:
- migration discipline
- backup integrity verification
- restore drills and recovery playbooks
- observability, alerts, and degradation modes
- benchmark and regression gates across semantic, lifecycle, and distributed behavior

Mandatory deliverables:
- tranche feature `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`
- migration and rollback procedures for long-lived data
- backup verification tooling or documented operational flow
- restore drill procedure with recorded evidence
- alerting and degradation behavior for core failure classes
- benchmark suite updates where retrieval or lifecycle behavior changed

Mandatory tests and evidence:
- migration tests across supported schema transitions
- backup and restore verification tests or drills
- failure-mode tests for degraded but still safe operation
- benchmark evidence for retrieval, conflict leakage, latency, and explain completeness where relevant

Tranche C Definition of Done:
- operators can migrate, back up, restore, and recover safely
- critical failures are observable
- regressions are caught before release by explicit gates

## Tranche D: Product Closure Review

Goal: Decide whether Aegis deserves the label "complete" for the selected deployment class.

Open a new feature for this tranche before final completion claims.

Feature charter:
- compare implemented behavior against the `041` completion contract
- document unresolved gaps
- state final non-goals and support boundaries
- confirm whether completion is valid for local-only, managed distributed, or both deployment classes

Mandatory deliverables:
- tranche feature `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`
- closure report comparing Tranches A, B, and C against `041`
- final risk register
- explicit go or no-go decision on "complete" status

Mandatory tests and evidence:
- compile the evidence from all prior tranches
- verify all acceptance and success criteria have supporting proof
- note any residual risks that block a "100% complete" claim

Tranche D Definition of Done:
- completion is a justified governance decision with evidence
- if gaps remain, Aegis is not called complete

## Cross-Tranche Rules

These rules apply to every tranche feature:

- start with Spec Kit before major implementation
- preserve local-first default operation
- preserve explainable retrieval
- preserve safe mutation by default
- prefer brownfield extension over rewrite
- record validation evidence in feature artifacts, not only in chat or ad hoc notes
- do not merge speculative platform complexity without measurable benefit

## Developer Assignment Model

Use this assignment pattern for every tranche:

1. Open the tranche feature in `specs/*`.
2. Write or refine `spec.md`.
3. Write `plan.md` with constitution check and validation plan.
4. Break work into reviewable tasks in `tasks.md`.
5. Implement the code in bounded slices.
6. Run tests, benchmarks, and workflow checks.
7. Record evidence in the feature artifacts.
8. Close the tranche before opening the next one.

Each developer task should include:
- the active feature name
- exact in-scope modules
- acceptance criteria
- required tests
- required evidence
- explicit non-goals

## Review Checklist For Maintainers

Before accepting "done" for any tranche, verify:

- the developer worked under an active feature in `specs/*`
- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` are present and current
- code matches acceptance boundaries
- tests and benchmarks relevant to the change were run
- validation evidence is recorded in the feature artifacts
- migration, rollback, and audit implications are addressed
- remaining risks are stated explicitly

## Final Gate For "100% Complete"

The maintainers may use the label "100% complete" only if:

- Tranches A through D are each implemented as closed features
- all required tests and validations have passed
- no unresolved gap remains against the `041` completion contract
- closure review explicitly approves the claim

If any one of these is missing, Aegis is not yet complete.

# Implementation Plan: Aegis v10 Runtime

**Branch**: `069-aegis-v10-runtime` | **Date**: 2026-03-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](/home/hali/.openclaw/extensions/memory-aegis-v10/specs/069-aegis-v10-runtime/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/069-aegis-v10-runtime/spec.md`

## Summary

Upgrade the Python-owned runtime from the current v4-shaped engine to an explicit v10 flow by hardening evidence-first ingest, adding a validation and policy gate, persisting explicit memory states plus transition history, exposing specialized storage facades, introducing a governed background planning layer, and routing retrieval through a retrieval orchestrator.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+  
**Primary Dependencies**: stdlib, sqlite3, pytest  
**Storage**: SQLite with FTS5 and incremental SQL migrations  
**Testing**: pytest  
**Target Platform**: Linux local runtime  
**Project Type**: library plus CLI/MCP runtime  
**Performance Goals**: Preserve current local-first behavior and keep retrieval bounded by existing stage budgets  
**Constraints**: Offline-capable, backward-compatible enough for current tests and runtime surfaces, no destructive autonomous mutation in background mode  
**Scale/Scope**: Incremental runtime architecture upgrade inside `aegis_py`

## Constitution Check

- Preserve Python-owned semantics as the production runtime.
- Keep changes explainable and test-backed.
- Prefer additive architecture over destructive rewrite because the repo is already mid-migration and dirty.

**Structure Decision**: Keep the existing six-module runtime intact and add a focused `aegis_py/v10/` layer that composes new architecture primitives instead of forking the whole engine.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Additive `v10` facade layer | Needed to upgrade architecture without destabilizing the repo-wide Python migration | Rewriting the existing modules in place would create higher regression risk in a dirty worktree |

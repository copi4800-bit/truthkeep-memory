# Implementation Plan: Beast Depth Tranches

**Branch**: `023-beast-depth-tranches` | **Date**: 2026-03-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](/home/hali/.openclaw/extensions/memory-aegis-v7/specs/023-beast-depth-tranches/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/023-beast-depth-tranches/spec.md`

## Summary

Convert the roadmap into concrete implementation tranches for the remaining partial beasts so future features can deepen Aegis in bounded, justified slices.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: canonical beast map, `022-beast-execution-roadmap`, current `aegis_py` runtime  
**Storage**: repo-tracked markdown and the existing six-module Python architecture  
**Testing**: prerequisite check plus documentation review  
**Constraints**: keep tranche count small, keep public API surface compact, and tie deeper work to measurable gates rather than lore enthusiasm  

## Constitution Check

- `Local-First Memory Engine`: Pass.
- `Brownfield Refactor Over Rewrite`: Pass.
- `Explainable Retrieval Is Non-Negotiable`: Pass.
- `Safe Memory Mutation By Default`: Pass.
- `Measured Simplicity`: Pass.

## Design Direction

- group partial beasts into a few execution tranches rather than many isolated features
- align tranche boundaries with the six-module runtime
- gate deeper work behind benchmark, safety, or operator signals
- leave `deferred` and already-strong `current` beasts outside the tranche backlog unless new evidence reopens them

## Work Plan

1. reconcile `.planning/STATE.md` to feature `023-beast-depth-tranches`
2. extend the canonical beast map with execution tranches for the remaining partial beasts
3. record tranche entry gates and module touchpoints in the canonical beast map
4. validate feature resolution through the canonical prerequisite workflow

## Validation Plan

- run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks`

## Validation Evidence

Observed on 2026-03-24 after creating 023-beast-depth-tranches:

- `.planning/STATE.md` now anchors the coordination layer to `023-beast-depth-tranches`
- the canonical beast architecture document now includes concrete execution tranches for all remaining `partial` beasts
- each tranche now records module touchpoints and explicit entry gates so deeper beast work stays justified and bounded

Validation results:

- `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks`
  - passed
  - `FEATURE_DIR=/home/hali/.openclaw/extensions/memory-aegis-v7/specs/023-beast-depth-tranches`
  - `AVAILABLE_DOCS=["tasks.md"]`

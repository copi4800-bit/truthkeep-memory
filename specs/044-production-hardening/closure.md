# Closure Evidence: 044 Production Hardening

## Summary

`044-production-hardening` was executed as the active tranche for moving Aegis v4 from "runtime exists" to "runtime is validated and operationally hardened enough to claim a stable local-first baseline."

This closure records repo-local evidence only. The source of truth remains the feature artifacts under `specs/044-production-hardening/`.

## What Closed In This Tranche

- The Python-owned runtime boundary was reinforced across docs, plugin metadata, MCP surface, and the TypeScript shell adapter.
- The previously failing Python regression cases around semantic dedupe, semantic recall, trust/conflict visibility, Weaver link behavior, scoped restore, legacy schema repair, and decay override were fixed.
- Versioned migration handling remained active through `aegis_py/ops/migration.py` and `aegis_py/storage/migrations/001_baseline.sql`.
- Backup, preview, list, and restore flows were validated through runtime integration tests and dedicated operations tests.
- A dedicated benchmark gate for latency and trust visibility now exists at `tests/benchmarks/test_latency_sli.py`.

## Canonical Validation Commands

Python runtime suite:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests
```

TypeScript adapter parity suite:

```bash
node_modules/.bin/vitest run test/integration/python-adapter-plugin.test.ts
```

## Observed Validation Results

Observed after the hardening changes in this tranche:

- Python runtime suite: `144 passed`
- TypeScript adapter integration suite: `17 passed`

Additional targeted evidence used during closure:

- `tests/operations/test_migration.py`
- `tests/operations/test_backup.py`
- `tests/benchmarks/test_latency_sli.py`
- backup/restore integration coverage in `tests/test_integration.py`

## Residual Scope

This tranche establishes a validated local-first baseline. It does not claim that every future operational concern is complete forever.

Open follow-up work that may still warrant future bounded features:

- richer explicit health-state modeling if sync/offline transitions become more complex
- broader benchmark corpora and release automation
- packaging and release-process polish beyond the validated local runtime

## Closure Statement

For the current codebase and current feature contract, `044-production-hardening` has repo-local evidence that:

- the Python-owned runtime is stable against the current regression suite
- the adapter shell remains in parity
- migration and backup flows are no longer only aspirational
- benchmark and trust-visibility gates exist in code, not only in prose

# Implementation Plan: Consumer Closure Review

**Branch**: `050-consumer-closure-review` | **Date**: 2026-03-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/050-consumer-closure-review/spec.md`

## Summary

Perform the final consumer-readiness closure review against `046-consumer-ready-checklist` after the onboarding, everyday-surface, and recovery/trust tranches. The goal is to decide whether Aegis v4 can truthfully be labeled consumer-complete or whether unresolved partial items still block that claim.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown feature artifacts, existing Python and TypeScript repo evidence  
**Primary Dependencies**: `046-consumer-ready-checklist`, `047-consumer-onboarding`, `048-consumer-everyday-surface`, `049-consumer-recovery-trust`, current validated code and tests  
**Storage**: N/A  
**Testing**: evidence review and prerequisite check; relies on prior tranche validation evidence rather than new runtime changes  
**Target Platform**: current OpenClaw local-first runtime and host integration path  
**Project Type**: governance and closure decision artifact  
**Performance Goals**: N/A  
**Constraints**: must not approve completion while required checklist items remain partial; must keep the verdict evidence-based and repo-native  
**Scale/Scope**: one closure review artifact set

## Constitution Check

- **Local-First Memory Engine**: Pass. The closure review judges the current local-first product state rather than changing runtime semantics.
- **Brownfield Refactor Over Rewrite**: Pass. No rewrite or new runtime path is proposed here.
- **Explainable Retrieval Is Non-Negotiable**: Pass. The review preserves prior explainability requirements.
- **Safe Memory Mutation By Default**: Pass. The review includes recovery and trust evidence rather than weakening it.
- **Measured Simplicity**: Pass. The review reduces ambiguity to a single governed decision.

## Evidence Base

Primary evidence sources:

- [specs/046-consumer-ready-checklist/plan.md](/home/hali/.openclaw/extensions/memory-aegis-v7/specs/046-consumer-ready-checklist/plan.md)
- [specs/047-consumer-onboarding/plan.md](/home/hali/.openclaw/extensions/memory-aegis-v7/specs/047-consumer-onboarding/plan.md)
- [specs/048-consumer-everyday-surface/plan.md](/home/hali/.openclaw/extensions/memory-aegis-v7/specs/048-consumer-everyday-surface/plan.md)
- [specs/049-consumer-recovery-trust/plan.md](/home/hali/.openclaw/extensions/memory-aegis-v7/specs/049-consumer-recovery-trust/plan.md)
- current repo files that still show residual host/legacy complexity, including `src/aegis-manager.ts`, `src/ux/onboarding.ts`, and the broader plugin surface in `index.ts`

## Review Matrix

| Checklist Item | Current State | Closure Judgment |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| CRC-001 Simple everyday verbs | `MET` | sufficient |
| CRC-002 Stable local runtime | `MET` | sufficient |
| CRC-003 Human-readable diagnostics | `MET` | sufficient |
| CRC-004 Real onboarding path | `MET` | sufficient |
| CRC-005 No dependency on retired paths | `MET` | sufficient |
| CRC-006 Safe recovery for ordinary users | `MET` | sufficient |
| CRC-007 Guided host integration | `MET` | sufficient |
| CRC-008 Evidence-backed completion claim | `MET` | sufficient |

## Closure Decision

**Decision**: `GO`

Aegis v4 may now be called **consumer-complete for the current local-first deployment class**.

## Rationale

The repo now satisfies the consumer-readiness checklist:

- onboarding is live on the Python-owned path
- default status and diagnostics are plain-language first
- backup and restore trust surfaces are significantly improved for ordinary users
- the local-first runtime contract is validated and stable
- retired TS-era onboarding ambiguity has been converted into explicit legacy stubs
- the plugin manifest and README now describe one bounded ordinary-user host path distinct from advanced tools

## Residual Risks

- **Advanced operator surface remains present**: advanced tools still exist for operators and integrations, but they are now clearly separated from the default consumer path rather than acting as blockers.
- **Deployment-class boundary matters**: this `GO` decision applies to the current local-first deployment class, not to a broader managed distributed platform claim.

## Minimum Next Feature Area

No additional consumer-readiness blocker is required for the local-first deployment class.

If maintainers later want to broaden the claim beyond the current local-first deployment class, the next features should target support boundaries for wider host/deployment contexts rather than reopening the current consumer checklist.

## Validation Closeout

Closure review completed on 2026-03-28 using the validated evidence recorded in `046` through `051`.

Observed governing outcome:

- consumer-readiness checklist is satisfied for the current local-first deployment class
- no required checklist item remains `PARTIAL` or `MISSING`
- the correct closure decision is `GO`

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations currently require exception handling.

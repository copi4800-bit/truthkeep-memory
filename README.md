# Memory Aegis v10 — The Constitutional Memory Engine 🛡️

**A Governance-First memory engine for AI agents. Truth over Score. Policy over Guesswork.**

Aegis v10 is a long-term memory system that enforces truth through a **5-tier Constitutional Policy pipeline (C0-C4)**. Every memory must pass through hard governance rules before it can be returned to the user, ensuring absolute accuracy and zero hallucination leakage.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ⚖️ Constitutional Governance (C0-C4)
Every retrieval result is filtered through 5 precedence layers:

| Level | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| **C0** | System Safety | Block harmful or illegal content |
| **C1** | User Override | User corrections always take priority |
| **C2** | Canonical Truth | Hard-exclude superseded facts, protect slot winners |
| **C3** | Governance Risk | Quarantine high-conflict memories, budget pressure escalation |
| **C4** | Soft Judgment | Filter low-relevance results |

### 🧠 Residual Judgment Engine
Mathematical scoring core with a four-tier residual formula:
```
S_final = S_base + Δ_judge + Δ_life + H_constraints
```
- **Base**: Initial semantic/lexical recall signal
- **Judge**: Truth alignment, evidence strength, conflict penalties
- **Life**: Temporal decay and habit-based readiness
- **Constraints**: Hard floors for superseded/archived records

### 🔐 Truth Registry
Manages fact ownership with margin-aware winner selection:
- **Winner**: The current truth. Always returned. Protected by `C2_SLOT_WINNER_PROTECTION`.
- **Contender**: Competing fact pending review. Surfaces only in audit mode.
- **Superseded**: Old truth. Hard-excluded from normal recall.

### 🗣️ Zero-Locking Identity
No hardcoded pronouns or persona labels. The system learns persona exclusively from explicit user commands and adapts immediately.

### 🩺 Health Diagnostics
Built-in memory health monitoring with 4 severity levels, conflict detection, staleness tracking, and actionable remediation guidance.

### 📝 Explainable Results
Every result includes a human-readable reason, policy trace, trust state, and suppressed candidates with "why-not" explanations for full transparency.

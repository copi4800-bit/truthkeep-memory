# Feature Specification: Beast Execution Roadmap

**Feature Branch**: `022-beast-execution-roadmap`  
**Created**: 2026-03-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Turn the 23 beasts into a smart execution roadmap using GSD + Spec Kit so Aegis stays powerful without becoming bloated"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Canonical Smart Build Order (Priority: P1)

As an Aegis maintainer, I want one canonical roadmap that orders the 23 beasts by execution value so future work expands the engine without architecture drag.

**Why this priority**: The repo now has the beast map, but maintainers still need a build order that says what should be deepened first and what should stay bounded.

**Independent Test**: Review the roadmap and verify that each beast is assigned to an execution tier with a rationale grounded in the current Python engine.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a contributor wants to deepen Aegis, **When** they read the roadmap, **Then** they can see which beasts are core moat, high-leverage support, or optional depth.
2. **Given** a maintainer is choosing the next feature, **When** they consult the roadmap, **Then** they can justify the choice through benchmark, safety, or operator value rather than lore alone.

### User Story 2 - Keep The Runtime Compressed (Priority: P1)

As an Aegis architect, I want explicit split/no-split rules so the 23 beasts remain design vocabulary without forcing 23 peer runtime subsystems.

**Why this priority**: Without a formal compression rule, the repo could drift into unnecessary packages, APIs, and coordination overhead.

**Independent Test**: Review the roadmap and confirm it states when a beast may become a standalone subsystem and when it must remain folded into one of the six modules.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a contributor wants to split out a beast, **When** they read the roadmap, **Then** they find concrete criteria such as distinct state, algorithms, tests, or operator controls.
2. **Given** a contributor wants to keep implementation compact, **When** they follow the roadmap, **Then** they can preserve the six-module model while still covering all 23 beasts.

### User Story 3 - Reconcile Workflow State (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer, I want the GSD + Spec Kit artifacts updated for this roadmap feature so the repo coordination layer stays aligned with the new direction.

**Why this priority**: The user explicitly asked for Spec Kit plus SPD/GSD execution, so the roadmap needs first-class feature artifacts rather than an informal note.

**Independent Test**: Run the prerequisite check and confirm it resolves to `022-beast-execution-roadmap` with task artifacts present.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the roadmap feature is active, **When** I run the prerequisite check, **Then** the repo resolves to the `022` feature instead of the previous sync feature.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The repo MUST define a canonical execution roadmap that classifies all 23 beasts into implementation tiers grounded in the current Python engine.
- **FR-002**: The roadmap MUST preserve the existing six-module runtime model and MUST NOT recommend exposing 23 peer public runtime subsystems.
- **FR-003**: The roadmap MUST define explicit split/no-split criteria for deciding when a beast deserves its own subsystem.
- **FR-004**: The roadmap MUST identify the highest-priority beasts for near-term execution and explain why they are prioritized.
- **FR-005**: The roadmap MUST identify which beasts should remain bounded or optional until benchmark, safety, or operator pressure justifies deeper work.
- **FR-006**: The roadmap MUST reconcile `.planning/STATE.md` to the active `022-beast-execution-roadmap` feature.
- **FR-007**: Repo-tracked documentation MUST reflect the smart-compression strategy through GSD + Spec Kit artifacts.

### Key Entities

- **Execution Tier**: A priority class such as core moat, high-leverage support, or optional depth that determines how strongly a beast should be implemented next.
- **Compression Rule**: A standard for deciding whether a beast stays inside one of the six modules or earns a standalone subsystem.
- **Roadmap Gate**: A measurable condition such as benchmark gain, safety need, or operator pain that justifies deeper implementation.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Contributors can point to one repo-tracked document that explains how all 23 beasts should be implemented without inflating the runtime structure.
- **SC-002**: The roadmap explicitly identifies the near-term moat beasts and the bounded or optional beasts.
- **SC-003**: The prerequisite check resolves to `022-beast-execution-roadmap` with its `tasks.md` artifact present.

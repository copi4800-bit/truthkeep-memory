# Implementation Plan: Beast Execution Roadmap

**Branch**: `022-beast-execution-roadmap` | **Date**: 2026-03-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](/home/hali/.openclaw/extensions/memory-aegis-v10/specs/022-beast-execution-roadmap/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/022-beast-execution-roadmap/spec.md`

## Summary

Turn the 23 beasts into a practical execution roadmap: keep the six-module runtime, define smart compression rules, and prioritize beasts by moat, safety, and operator value.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: current `aegis_py` six-module runtime, Spec Kit artifacts, beast architecture map  
**Storage**: repo-tracked markdown planning artifacts and existing SQLite runtime boundaries  
**Testing**: prerequisite check plus documentation review  
**Constraints**: do not expand public runtime/tool surfaces unnecessarily, keep beast language internal, align with shipped Python capabilities rather than blueprint fantasy  

## Constitution Check

- `Local-First Memory Engine`: Pass.
- `Brownfield Refactor Over Rewrite`: Pass.
- `Explainable Retrieval Is Non-Negotiable`: Pass.
- `Safe Memory Mutation By Default`: Pass.
- `Measured Simplicity`: Pass.

## Design Direction

- keep `23 beasts` as internal capability vocabulary
- keep runtime implementation compressed into `memory`, `retrieval`, `hygiene`, `profiles`, `storage`, and `integration`
- prioritize beasts that improve recall quality, safety, or operator trust first
- deepen optional beasts only when benchmark movement or operational pain justifies the complexity

## Work Plan

1. reconcile `.planning/STATE.md` to feature `022-beast-execution-roadmap`
2. update the canonical beast architecture doc with execution tiers and split/no-split rules
3. record the implementation roadmap in `tasks.md` so later features can inherit a stable sequence
4. validate feature resolution through the canonical prerequisite workflow

## Validation Plan

- run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks`

## Validation Evidence

Observed on 2026-03-24 after creating 022-beast-execution-roadmap:

- `.planning/STATE.md` now anchors the repo coordination layer to `022-beast-execution-roadmap`
- the canonical beast architecture document now includes smart compression guidance, execution tiers, and split/no-split rules
- `Weaver Beast` status in the canonical map is reconciled to current shipped Python capabilities instead of the earlier stale target-only note

Validation results:

- `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks`
  - passed
  - `FEATURE_DIR=/home/hali/.openclaw/extensions/memory-aegis-v10/specs/022-beast-execution-roadmap`
  - `AVAILABLE_DOCS=["tasks.md"]`

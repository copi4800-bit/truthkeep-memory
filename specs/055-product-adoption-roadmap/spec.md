# Feature Specification: Product Adoption Roadmap

**Feature Branch**: `055-product-adoption-roadmap`  
**Created**: 2026-03-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Turn the “Aegis should steal the good parts” direction into an execution roadmap that borrows winning tactics from Mem0, NeuralMemory, and strong RAG systems without weakening Aegis core discipline.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Maintainer Can See What To Borrow And What Not To Trade Away (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer, I want one explicit roadmap that lists the specific product traits Aegis should adopt from other memory systems and the non-negotiable Aegis core that must remain intact, so future improvements do not drift into a copycat architecture.

**Independent Test**: Open the roadmap artifact and verify that it lists specific “steal” targets, grouped by source inspiration, alongside explicit Aegis invariants that must not be traded away.

### User Story 2 - The 12 High-Value Improvements Are Ordered Into Real Tranches (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer, I want the twelve adoption items turned into phased execution waves, so the repo can improve onboarding, packaging, docs, demos, retrieval UX, and integrations without trying to do everything at once.

**Independent Test**: Verify that the roadmap groups the twelve items into prioritized tranches with clear goals, entry criteria, and evidence targets.

### User Story 3 - Future Features Can Point Back To One Governing Product Strategy (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer, I want GSD and Spec Kit planning to point at one governing adoption roadmap, so future product-facing work can clearly state which item it is implementing and why.

**Independent Test**: Verify that `.planning/ROADMAP.md` and `.planning/STATE.md` reference the new adoption roadmap as the next product-facing strategy layer after consumer-complete baseline work.

## Requirements

- **FR-001**: The repository MUST include a roadmap artifact that lists the twelve high-value product traits Aegis should adopt from competing memory systems.
- **FR-002**: The roadmap MUST distinguish between tactics Aegis should borrow and core strategic properties Aegis must preserve.
- **FR-003**: The twelve items MUST be grouped into prioritized implementation tranches with clear product intent.
- **FR-004**: The roadmap MUST map each tranche to concrete evidence targets such as quickstart, demos, docs, benchmark UX, packaging, integration story, or retrieval/citation UX.
- **FR-005**: GSD planning artifacts MUST reference the roadmap so future work can treat it as the governing product-adoption layer rather than relying on chat-only intent.

## Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: A maintainer can read one roadmap and understand the twelve things Aegis should copy tactically, the core traits it must keep strategically, and the order of execution.
- **SC-002**: The roadmap makes it obvious that Aegis should become easier to use, easier to love, and better productized without weakening correctness, trust, or local-first discipline.
- **SC-003**: Future features can cite the roadmap as the reason a product-facing change exists.
